- 👋 Hi, I’m @MartiniBnu, I've never had the habit of sharing my solutions, that's why this desert here, but from 2021 I want to dive head first into collaboration and I'll start bringing some solutions and lessons here!
 
- 👀 I’m interested in PLSQL, Oracle Apex, Data Science and Backend Web Development!

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Data Science and Web Technologies...

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project that can help with my expertise and learn from the community in technologies that I'm learning

- 📫 How to reach me: martini.bnu@gmail.com
